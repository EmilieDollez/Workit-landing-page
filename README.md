## My process

- Step 1 :

I started by working on the "mobile" design because Tailwind is designed with a "Mobile First" approach. 
I spent a lot of time on it because I encountered many issues with fonts that never had the expected appearance.

### Built with

- Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

I was able to upgrade my skill set with Tailwind CSS : 
- I used new properties like 'tracking' or 'negative margins' to avoid relying on 'relative/absolute' positioning all the time.
- I've learned to customize my CSS properties more, such as 'font-face,' and to use custom variables more often to achieve a design that closely matches the Figma model.

I also discovered 'variables fonts'. However, I had some difficulty using them, and my headings don't always have the expected appearance. I've made a note to delve deeper into this aspect as part of my skill development.

### Continued development

I would like to work with variables fonts again, as they appear to be very useful for avoiding overloading the project with many fonts files for each weight.

### Useful resources

- [Variables Fonts](https://www.dharsh.dev/blog/variable-web-fonts-with-nextjs-and-tailwindcss) - This helped me to understand Variables Fonts.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - Tailwind's documentation.
